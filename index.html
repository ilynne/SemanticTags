      <h1>Knitting is Cool</h1>
      <p>I learned to knit and crochet as a child. I never actually finished a project bigger than a hamster blanket, though. After being hit by a car in 2011 I took it up again as hand therapy. I surprised myself by actually finising a pair of socks. I moved on to a piece I have knitted over an over because it's so geeky: a Fibonacci Mobius scarf.</p>
      <h2>My Next Project</h2>
      <p>I've had my eye on this piece for over a year. I needed the perfect yarn, something the color of Seattle. Madelintosh nailed the colorway -- grey, green, blue and brown. Even the name, <em>Thrift Shop Dress Shirt</em>, says "Seattle." I cannot wait to get started on this beautiful scarf/shawl/cowl/poncho.</p>
